									Compared to the other existing home technologies that have fragmented services and products. MOBHASS provides the homeowner with a central access point that removes the need for several remotes and apps. MOBHASS provides you with the convenience of monitoring electronic devices that can be controlled by an app such as lights, fans, and windows. It will make it easy to control everything in your home, seamlessly done from a single app.

									Internet connections are far more reliable nowadays it&#39s allowing us to communicate without restrictions and help us in our daily lives but still, Internet outages happened by broken cables, typhoons, or equipment failures. MOBHASS can fully work independently of the internet by having manual switches you can still use your device&#39s functionality even when the internet connection is unavailable.

									Home automation units come with security benefits like RFID technology and CCTV (IP Cam) that are used in the system. RFID technology is placed at the door and offers more security and convenience to the users by simply tapping the registered key card into the RFID reader and CCTV (IP Cam) can only stream in the home vicinity and can notify the household/ users even they are far from the house as long as they have MoBHASS application and connected to the internet.

									Home automation products can help you in managing energy consumption in your home. For instance, you can automatically turn off the lighting in any room with the help of the MOBHASS app. That way, you do not waste energy when no one is around. This app can help you synchronize all the devices in your home with real-time information. And will help you to save energy, including switches, power outlets, and lighting control systems.

										<p class="under-feature-p">	
										We are removing the traditional way of accessing your door using an RFID (Radio-frequency identification) door locking system that offers more security and convenience to your home. MOBHASS featured a fixed RFID reader, which is commonly mounted on walls and is attached to a given location. To unlock and open the door, the household member simply taps his or her registered key card into the RFID reader.
										<br>
										<br>
										Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is the non-contact wireless transmission of data using radiofrequency waves. In an RFID door lock access control system, each household member's credential (typically a keycard or fob with an RFID chip) contains unique identifying information called a tag.

Turning on or off your devices like light bulbs (auto volts) and fans (220 - 240 volts), within your app is an effortless and quick way of regulating their state. 
											<br><br>
											The window lock system can keep your home more protected by providing the homeowner access to control and manage the status of a window by closing and opening through an app. A servomotor is linked to the nodeMCU, which is capable of connecting items and transferring data via the Wi-Fi protocol.

											<br><br>
											Aside from security surveillance, MOBHASS integrated it with facial recognition and it will send a notification to the application, which helps identify the intruder or unauthorized personnel.
